# Spotistats Plus FAQ

## Is Spotistats Plus the same as Spotify Premium?

No, **Spotistats Plus** will unlock only certain functions within the **Spotistats app** and is not linked to **Spotify Premium** or your Spotify account.

## Is Spotistats Plus a subscription?

Nope, Spotistats Plus is a one time purchase.

## I bought Spotistats Plus and want to use more advanced features, what do I need to do?

Follow this [guide](../import/streaming-history) to import your streaming history.

## I bought Plus but there are no changes to the app

### iOS

There are some issues with the App Store, meaning it can take a couple of days before your purchase is verified. You can try to click _Restore purchases_ every day and it should work sometime soon.

#### It's been a week and my Plus still isn't activated

Unfortunately there's no way for me to check the status of your purchase. There are two things you can do:

- Try to purchase it again. Spotistats Plus is a so-called "non-consumable" in app purchase, which means you can only buy it once (and only get charged once). If the purchase proceeds that means that the previous purchase has failed. If the purchase fails and says "You already own this item, you'll receive it for free" that means that the previous purchase has indeed went through.
- Contact Apple's App Store support to check the status of your purchase at ([getsupport.apple.com](https://getsupport.apple.com)).

### Android

If you don't have Plus after purchasing it, this can mean two things:

- Your payment is still pending (this happens a lot when paying with a credit card)
- The purchase failed

There are two things you can do to check this:

- Try to purchase it again. Spotistats Plus is a so-called "non-consumable" in app purchase, which means you can only buy it once (and only get charged once). If the purchase proceeds that means that the previous purchase has failed. If the purchase fails and says "You already own this item, you'll receive it for free" that means that the previous purchase has indeed went through.
- Wait at least a day and click _Restore purchases_. If this doesn't work, you can send me an email with the following details so I can check the status of the order:
  - The Google order ID. You can find this in the email with your receipt and it should start with `GPA.`
  - The email address linked to your Google Play account
  - A link to your Spotistats or Spotify profile

## Can I transfer my Plus purchase to another account?

It's possible to transfer your Plus purchase to another account. This is useful when your old account got hacked and you created a new account. This is also possible if you've won Plus through a giveaway.

### How to request a transfer

Send an email to [support@stats.fm](mailto:support@stats.fm) with the following details:

- A link to your old Spotify profile
- A link to your new Spotify profile

In order to validate you own both accounts, you need to follow [this Spotify profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/zwm5ckwimgvmvl1r2ih4xko25) with both accounts. After the transfer is done, you can unfollow it if you'd like :)

### Can you transfer my stats too?

Unfortunately, it's not possible to transfer your stats right now. If you want to merge your stats from your old account into your new one, your only option is to [request your endsong files from your old account](../import/streaming-history) and upload them into your new account.
